## Chandler's Personal Site

#### PAT Stack
My site uses the fabled **PAT** stack, named after my family friend Pat:
- ***P**HP*, the one true web dev language
- ***A**lpine.js*, for interactivity
- ***T**ailwindCSS*, for styling

*But why use the PAT stack when there are so many other options?* Besdies Pat being my friend, there's no build process, no webpack, no hot reload, no real advantages. The PAT stack is just the sheer brute force of HTML and PHP hurled across the internet like God intended. 

#### Local Development

If for some reason you want to clone this for you own local development, all that's needed is to install Tailwind and start the watcher with `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch`. *That's it*. Patty's got you.
