#### PAT Stack
As far as I know, this site is the first implementation of the **PAT** stack, named after my family friend Pat:
- ***P**HP*, the one true web dev language
- ***A**lpine.js*, for interactivity
- ***T**ailwindCSS*, for styling

*But why use the PAT stack when there are so many other options?* Besdies Pat being my friend, there's no build process, no webpack, no hot reload, no advantages. Functional Components? Huh? The PAT stack is just the sheer brute force of HTML and PHP hurled across the internet like God intended. Go ahead and load this bad boy on an iphone5 on a 3G network and behold the power of the PAT stack.

#### Local Development

If for some reason you want to clone this for local development, all that's needed is to install Tailwind and start the watcher with `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch`. *That's it*. Patty's got you.
